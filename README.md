SmartV is an online video streaming company that offers online video services including streaming, searching, delivery, editing, transcoding and adaption over the internet. SmartV are considering moving their infrastructure to the cloud to keep up with the increasing demand of their clients. The significant and scalable amount of storage and computation required by SmartVâ€™s millions of user users aligns with the benefits of cloud infrastructure services. The business requirements for SmartV are important to understand to assess the correct scope for cloud infrastructure projects.
As the company is rapidly growing with an increase in clients and demand, scalable infrastructure is needed to guarantee the sustainability of the platform for the future. SmartV offers video streaming services which utilise large amounts of storage and bandwidth. Hence, SmartV requires sufficient and highly available storage and networking capabilities to keep up with the growing demand of the platform. This must be deployable in all regions being served. Security is crucial for users of internet companies who store sensitive user data of clients. Hence, a combination of security measures mut be implemented to meet regulatory requirements and protect the platform form attacks and breaches. For example, end-to-end encryption is required to ensure that the transferring of data is not intercepted, and only the intended recipient can decrypt the data.
SmartV requires minimal downtime so that their services are always accessible to customers. Hence, redundant infrastructure will need to be deployed to handle faults. Regular backups are crucial and should be stored in a secure location that is isolated from the main infrastructure. Finally, the cloud infrastructure must be sufficiently powerful to support streaming, searching, delivery editing, transcoding, adaption, user and system management. SmartV requires scalable deployment of these resources with high elasticity to minimise up-front cost by only paying for used compute power.
